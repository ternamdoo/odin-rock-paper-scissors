2. Once on the page, the user may interact with the game options on the UI to play the game.
3. A game round is played with a computer program once the user clicks a game option. Computer choice is always randomly generated on each round. The game logs each round's results and increments player scores when they win.
4. Once any user reaches 5 points (by winning 5 times), the current game iteration ends. A _Restart Game_ button appears below the game log and the user may click on it to play another iteration of the game. For now, the user can only start a new game after the current game ends.
